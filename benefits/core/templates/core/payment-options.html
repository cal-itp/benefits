    Cal-ITP is a new program serving all Californians.
    In order to activate your discount, you need a bank card that has the contactless symbol on it.
    The contactless symbol is four curved lines and it looks like this:
</p>
<p class="contactless-symbol">
    <img class="icon mx-auto d-block" src="{% static 'img/icon/contactless.svg' %}" alt="The contactless symbol" />
</p>
<p>A contactless bank card can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A credit card</li>
    <li>A debit card</li>
    <li>A prepaid card (if it includes a Visa logo)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working to add additional options for people who do not have access to a bank card. Please check back on this website, or get in touch with your local transit provider.</p>
<p>You can still get your discount by going through your local transit providerâ€™s application process.</p>
