!!! example "Message files"

    English messages: [benefits/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/benefits/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po)

The Cal-ITP Benefits application is fully internationalized and available in both English and Spanish.

It uses Django's built-in support for translation using [message files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/#term-message-file), which contain entries of `msgid`/`msgstr` pairs. The `msgid` is referenced in source code so that Django takes care of showing the `msgstr` for the user's language.

## Updating message files

Django has a utility command called `makemessages` to help maintain message files. It ensures that `msgid`s in the message files are actually used somewhere in source code and also detects new `msgid`s.

There is a helper script that runs this command with some arguments: [`bin/makemessages.sh`](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/bin/makemessages.sh)

```bash
bin/makemessages.sh
```

Developers should use this script to update message files in a consistent way.

## Workflow

### Updating English

Add English copy to templates directly first. Then, run the helper script, `bin/makemessages.sh`, so Django can update the `django.po` files for English and Spanish with the new copy.

### Updating Spanish

Find the English copy in the Spanish `django.po` file as a `msgid`, and add the corresponding Spanish translation as the `msgstr`. Again, run the helper script for formatting and `bin/init.sh` to confirm the translation is rendered properly.

### Adding agency-specific copy

When templates have different copy per agency, create a new template for that agency-specific copy to live in. See the example of the MST-specific agency index page file, named [`index--mst.html`](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/benefits/core/templates/core/index--mst.html). Include the agency-specific template file name in the migration object, as done here for [MST](https://github.com/cal-itp/benefits/blob/dev/benefits/core/migrations/0002_data.py#L260), with `eligibility_index_template="eligibility/index--mst.html"`.

### Fuzzy strings

From [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#message-files):

> `makemessages` sometimes generates translation entries marked as fuzzy, e.g. when translations are inferred from previously translated strings.

Usually, the inferred translation is [not correct](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10852#comment:3), so make sure to review the `msgstr` and fix it if necessary. Then, remove the commented lines starting with `#, fuzzy` (otherwise the entry will not be used).
