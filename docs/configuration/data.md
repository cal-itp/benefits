# Configuration data

!!! example "Helper migration file to define data migration order"

    [`benefits/core/migrations/0003_data_migration_order.py`][helper-migration]

    Since our initial data migration files are assumed to start with `0002` and depend only on `0001_initial`, this migration file ensures the migration graph has a defined order (which is required for the migration to run). It looks in the `benefits/core/migrations` directory for migration files starting with `0002` and declares them in its dependencies list.

    [How to provide initial data for models][django-load-initial-data]

## Introduction

Django [data migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/migrations/#data-migrations) are used to load the database with instances of the app's model classes, defined in [`benefits/core/models.py`][core-models].

Migrations are run as the application starts up. See the [`bin/init.sh`][init] script.

The sample data provided in the repository is sufficient to run the app locally and interact with e.g. the sample Transit
Agencies.

During the [deployment](../deployment/README.md) process, an environment-specific data migration is used to build that
environment's configuration database.

## Sample data

The sample data included in the repository is enough to bootstrap the application with basic functionality:

- Multiple transit agency configurations
- Multiple eligibility verification pathways
- With and without authentication required before eligibility verification
- In concert with the [sample eligibility server][eligibility-server], verification with test user data

### Not included

Some configuration data is not available with the samples in the repository:

- OAuth configuration to enable authentication (read more about [OAuth configuration](oauth.md))
- Rate Limiting configuration for eligibility
- reCAPTCHA configuration for user-submitted forms
- Payment processor configuration for the enrollment phase
- Amplitude configuration for capturing analytics events

### Sample transit agency: `ABC`

- Presents the user a choice between two different eligibility pathways
- One eligibility verifier requires authentication
- One eligibility verifier does not require authentication

### Sample transit agency: `DefTL`

- Single eligibility pathway, no choice presented to the user
- Eligibility verifier does not require authentication

## Building the configuration database

When the data migration changes, the configuration database needs to be rebuilt.

The file is called `django.db` and the following commands will rebuild it.

Run these commands from within the repository root, inside the devcontainer:

```bash
bin/init.sh
```

## Loading new data for different environment

Django will run all migration files found in an app's `migrations` module.

To load new data for a different environment:

1. (Optional) Set an environment variable `DJANGO_LOAD_SAMPLE_DATA` to `false` if you don't want the `core` app's sample data to be loaded.
1. Create a data migration file, and make sure the name is prefixed with `0002`. (The migration process for Benefits expects data migration files to named as such). The basic structure for the contents of this file is:
```python
from django.db import migrations


def load_data(app, *args, **kwargs):
    pass


class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [
        ("core", "0001_initial"),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(load_data),
    ]
```
1. Put this file under `benefits/core/migrations`
1. If `DJANGO_LOAD_SAMPLE_DATA` is `false`, you can also set [`DJANGO_MIGRATIONS_DIR`](../environment-variables/#django_migrations_dir) to a directory path, and put your data migration there.
