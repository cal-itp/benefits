        ## Prepare a new release

        Use the form below to prepare a new release of the Benefits app.

        Each release is coordinated by a **Release Manager**. The release manager may assign sub-tasks or ask for help
        as-needed, but is otherwise responsible for all aspects of the release.

        After this issue is created, use the checklist to manage the steps
        of the release process, marking items as completed. [Read more about the
        release process](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/deployment/release/).

        Close this issue when the checklist is complete.

        ## Release type

        Reference the diagram and discussion on [the release process docs](https://docs.calitp.org/benefits/deployment/release/).

        * `Regular` release: propagates from `dev` to `test`, and then `test` to `prod`. Only possible if `dev` is ready to deploy.
        * `Hotfix` release: fix is merged into `prod`. After release, fix is propagated to `dev` and `test`.
